  <h2>How to use FogTracker</h2>
  <p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
		Sign in to the application using your Google account, and create an integration profile with relevant information, including the URL of
		your FogBugz server (both standalone and hosted options are supported), authentication info used to access FogBugz and Tracker, and other
		options to customize the integration.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		After an integration profile is created, a token is returned to uniquely identify this profile. A list of existing tokens are always available
		once you login to the service, and you can click on any token to modify settings of that profile.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Go to your FogBugz account, install the <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/plugins/plugin.aspx?ixPlugin=5">URLTrigger plugin</a>, and
		create a new trigger that acts on <em>exactly</em> these five events: <span class="code">CaseResolved, CaseClosed, CaseReactivated, CaseReopened
		and CaseEdited</span>. In the <em>URL</em> field fill in the following URL: <span class="code">http://&lt;appid&gt;.appspot.com/&lt;token&gt;/URLTrigger/?CaseNumber={CaseNumber}&CaseEventID={CaseEventID}</span>.
		Here <em>&lt;appid&gt;</em> is the id of your AppEngine application, for this service use <em>fogtracker</em>; <em>&lt;token&gt;</em> is the token
		returned in the last step.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Go to your Tracker account, enter <em>Project Settings</em>, click the <em>Integrations</em> tab. In the <em>Activity Web Hook</em> section, enter
		the following URL as <em>Web Hook URL</em>: <span class="code">http://&lt;appid&gt;.appspot.com/&lt;token&gt;/WebHook/</span>.
		Then, in the <em>External Tool Integrations</em> section, create a new integration of type <em>Other</em>. Choose any name you like for the
		integration, leave blank for the username and password. In the <em>Base URL</em> field use that of your FogBugz installation: <span class="code">
		https://&lt;your_fogbugz_host&gt;/default.asp?</span>, the ticket number will be appended by Tracker to form the full url. Finally, in the
		<em>Import API URL</em> field, enter the following URL: <span class="code">http:/&lt;appid&gt;.appspot.com/&lt;token&gt;/CaseFeed/?q=&lt;query&gt;</span>
		Here <em>&lt;query&gt;</em> is the search string used to specify which FogBugz cases you want to include in the feed. Documentation on the syntax
		of the FogBugz search can be found <a href="http://fogbugz.stackexchange.com/questions/4399">here</a>. You probably want to at least specify a project
		using <em>project:"proj_name"</em>. Note that the system always retrieves only active cases that are not already imported into Tracker, and you
		don't have to specify these metrics in the query. You can create multiple integrations to put different kinds of FogBugz cases into different panels.
