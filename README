FogTracker is a Free and Open Source Software web application and a free service to
integrate FogBugz and Pivotal Tracker. It's written in Python and for Google AppEngine.

Key Features:
1. Two-way integration. A user can import a FogBugz case into Pivotal Tracker via
  Drag & Drop, or import a new or existing Pivotal Tracker story into FogBugz by
  assigning a special label to it. After the initial import, the FogBugz case and
  the Pivotal Tracker story are linked to each other, and any further change or
  comment on either side will be propagated to or reported in the other side.

2. You can link multiple FogBugz projects to one Pivotal Tracker project, multiple
  Pivotal Tracker projects to one FogBugz project, or multiple FogBugz projects to
  multiple Pivotal Tracker projects. However, each FogBugz case can only be linked
  with a single Pivotal Tracker story, and vice versa.

3. FogTracker works with both FogBugz On Demand and your private FogBugz server.
